# Integrations Directory

This directory contains external API integrations for LaunchPilot.

## Purpose

Centralized modules for connecting with external services:

- **OpenAI**: AI analysis and chat capabilities
- **Tavily**: Market research and search
- **Firecrawl**: Web scraping and data extraction
- **Google Trends**: Market trend analysis

## Structure

Each integration module provides:
- Clean API abstraction
- Error handling and fallbacks
- TypeScript interfaces
- Consistent return formats

## Future Development

Integration modules will be added here to:
1. Centralize external API logic
2. Improve code maintainability  
3. Enable easier testing and mocking
4. Provide consistent interfaces

Currently, external API logic remains in the tools/ directory and will be gradually extracted to this integrations/ directory.
